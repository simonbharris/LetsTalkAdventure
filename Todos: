Ideas and possible features:

Bugs:
  Keeping saying something like "Find games like this" will cause weird behavior.
    Would be cool if this driver only worked if there were games to pick from; or only accessible on certain screens.

Recommend adding (Suspected difficulty)
  Add visual option to "find games like" ("Find games like this" is implemented)
  Rework / redesign result/details screen to make it more visually attractive. (Hard)
  Active filters visible to the user (Easy-medium)
  Implement redirect links to external websites (Medium?)
  Display Age Rating (easy)
  Release  Status / date? (Easy-medium)
  "Show me more" (easy-medium?)

Maybe adding
  "Pagination", Store offset (for search) in a concept; have a conversation drivers to incrment or decrement offset
  Adding icons to the details screen to add some ZING!
  Multiple filters on same category, :IE Search for games on both PS4 and Xbox One
  Ask for list of categories / genres / themes
      Bring up tiles / options for the user to see and scroll through
  Blacklist (IE: exclude "Erotic" theme)
  Redirect too external websites to buy the item

Probably won't add:
  Out of scope / Bonus features:
    Rate from the app (May require user login, maybe redirect instead?)
    Take the game ID and ping their feed API for news / media stuff
    If platform == android, offer option to redirect to playstore?
    If Mobile game, check if user already own the game / offer to play if they do.
