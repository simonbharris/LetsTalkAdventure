Ideas and possible features:

Recommend adding (Suspected difficulty)
  Rework / redesign result/details screen to make it more visually attractive. (Hard)
  Active filters visible to the user (Easy)
  Implement redirect links to external websites (Medium?)
  Check for similar games (IGDB has an field for this on their Game JSON api) (Medium)
  Display Age Rating (easy)
  Release  Status / date? (Easy-medium)
  "Show me more" (easy-medium?)
  
  sort by: (Easy, (lets hope))
    Release date
    High rating
    Popularity (review count?)
    

Maybe adding:
  Adding icons to the details screen to add some ZING!
  Multiple filters on same category, :IE Search for games on both PS4 and Xbox One
  Ask for list of categories / genres / themes
      Bring up tiles / options for the user to see and scroll through
  Blacklist (IE: exclude "Erotic" theme)
  Redirect too external websites to buy the item

Probably won't add:
  Out of scope / Bonus features:
    Rate from the app (May require user login, maybe redirect instead?)
    Take the game ID and ping their feed API for news / media stuff
    If platform == android, offer option to redirect to playstore?
    If Mobile game, check if user already own the game / offer to play if they do.
